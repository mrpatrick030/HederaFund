HederaFund is a next-generation DeFi protocol transforming peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and borrowing through a secure, collateral-backed dApp. Designed to overcome the inefficiencies of traditional finance, HederaFund offers users a faster, more transparent, and more accessible lending experience.

Powered by the Hedera test network, HederaFund brings together robust smart contracts, seamless integrations, and a highly intuitive front-end interface. Users enjoy complete control over their assets and data, secured through wallet or email login — ensuring privacy and security at every step.

With the HederaFund dashboard, accessing the platform's full suite of features is effortless. Unlike traditional financial systems that involve lengthy approvals, high fees, and intermediaries, HederaFund provides:
* Instant access to lending and borrowing markets without the need for banks or credit checks
* Greater transparency through blockchain technology, ensuring fair and tamper-proof transactions
* Lower fees and better rates thanks to the low gas fees on Hedera network and the elimination of middlemen
* 24/7 global accessibility — no waiting for business hours or paperwork
* Enhanced security and user ownership of funds

## Benefits for Lenders on HederaFund:

### Attractive Returns:
Lenders earn interest on the funds they lend, based on the agreed loan terms — offering potentially higher yields compared to traditional savings accounts or investments.

### Collateral-Backed Security:
Every loan is backed by collateral. If a borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral, reducing the risk of loss.

### Decentralized, Trustless Transactions:
Lenders do not need to trust the borrower personally — smart contracts automatically enforce the loan terms and collateral handling.

### Full Control Over Funds:
Lenders choose which loans to fund based on the borrower's terms, amount, interest rate, and duration. They stay fully in control of where and how they allocate their capital.

### Transparency:
All loan details, collateral, and borrower activities are recorded transparently on-chain, giving lenders a clear view before making decisions.

### Private and Secure Communication:
Lenders can communicate directly with borrowers through HederaFund’s decentralized chat while maintaining full privacy.

### Participation in a Growing DeFi Ecosystem:
As HederaFund grows and adds more supported tokens and features, lenders benefit from a wider range of investment opportunities.

## Benefits for Borrowers on HederaFund:

### Access to Flexible Loans:
Borrowers can quickly access loans by providing collateral, without needing to go through lengthy credit checks like traditional banks require.

### Decentralized and Permissionless:
Anyone can borrow without middlemen, paperwork, or restrictions, as long as they meet the collateral requirements.

### Fast Funding:
Borrowers can receive funding almost instantly once a lender accepts their loan request, speeding up financial access.

### Privacy and Security:
Borrowers maintain control over their wallets and assets, with no need to expose personal information.

### Clear, Agreed Terms:
Loan amount, interest rate, duration, and collateral are all transparent and set before the loan starts — no hidden fees or surprises.

### Ownership of Collateral:
If no lender funds the loan before expiry, the borrower can reclaim their collateral easily and without penalties.

### Decentralized Communication:
Borrowers can chat securely and privately with potential lenders to discuss loan terms if needed.

### Opportunity for Building Trust:
Frequent successful repayments can help borrowers build a reputation within the HederaFund ecosystem, potentially making it easier to get better loan terms in the future.
HederaFund delivers a lending experience that not only matches but exceeds the capabilities of traditional finance, empowering users with true financial freedom.

![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmUXbi6jakjtUjDvxcZPCAMhbru2cWy2vviNwMWERVKFA4)
Since HederaFund is currently deployed on the Hedera network's testnet, you will need testnet HBAR to cover gas fees during transactions.
You can easily obtain testnet HBAR through the [Hedera testnet](https://portal.hedera.com/faucet).

### Web app homepage
The homepage of the HederaFund web app is the first page you’ll see when you visit the platform. It serves as the gateway to the HederaFund dashboard and features the Connect Wallet button, along with important resources such as platform information and documentation.

 ### The HederaFund Dashboard
This is the core functional area of HederaFund, bringing together the platform’s most essential features — including user balances, key metrics, the P2P lending and borrowing dApp and Swap.

### User's Balances
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmVbCZ3cwWUhVk4cRDCZrifUwVLtTWXKSQ52d1BZyLJGpR)
This section of the dashboard shows all the balances of a user after logging in. It displays the following info for a user: HDF balance, HDF price, HBAR balance, number of loans you created, number of loans you funded.

### Metrics
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmbMouw1PZSYqApPDHucXXqsz79c3KU7guNHjRugHQDevG)

## P2P Lend/Borrow dApp
HederaFund enables users to participate in unique P2P lending and borrowing activities involving supported tokens. To initiate the process, a borrower creates a loan request using the "Approve/Create Loan" buttons in the Borrow section. A lender can then fund the loan by using the "Fund Loan" button in the Lend section.
Each loan on HederaFund is defined by a loan amount, an interest rate, an expiry date, and collateral. The borrower's collateral is securely locked by the system until the loan's expiry. If no lender funds the loan before the expiry, the borrower can reclaim their collateral using the "Withdraw Collateral" button in the Lend section. Borrowers who successfully receive funding can withdraw the borrowed tokens using the "Withdraw Loan" button.
If a borrower fails to repay the loan by the expiry date, the lender has the right to claim the posted collateral through the "Claim Collateral" button. Lenders are rewarded generously based on the agreed terms of the loan, with additional security provided by HederaFund’s advanced security algorithms.
When borrowing through HederaFund, users must present sufficient collateral and repay the borrowed amount with interest using the "Repay Loan" button to fulfill their obligations.
For a better user experience, the dApp integrates features like a "View All Available Loans" section and a "View Your Loans" section, along with search functionality and pagination to easily navigate between loans. A decentralized chat is also available, allowing lenders and borrowers to communicate privately and efficiently.
New supported tokens and collateral options will continue to be added to the platform over time, ensuring HederaFund remains dynamic and versatile.

### Borrowing

To borrow, follow the steps below (Your wallet will popup to sign the transactions):
* Fill the details above setting the duration, amount of HBAR to borrow, collateral, collateral amount, "yes if collateral is ERC20 or no if collateral is ERC721 (an NFT)", and interest rate (which is the amount of interest you will pay to any user that funds your loan).
* Click on the "Approve" button to approve the loan transaction.
* Proceed to create the loan by clicking on the "Create Loan Request" button.
After creating the loan, you will be automatically navigated to the Lending section where you can monitor all your created/funded loans.

### Lending
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qmdho6SKao1R1vUiGu26Fk5aeQKyQMe4PkTmAUJeQxctor)
Lending on HederaFund is simpler than you might expect. Thanks to a smooth and intuitive user experience, users can easily carry out all lending activities. The platform features dedicated sections like "View All Loans", "Loans You Funded", and "Loans You Created" to help users effortlessly track their loan activities.
Search and pagination functionalities further enhance the usability of this powerful lending dApp.
To start lending, users can easily navigate and interact with the available action buttons provided within the dApp.
* Fund loan: This button is the button a user clicks on to fund a loan created by a borrower. No user can fund his own loan.
* Claim collateral: The claim collateral button is typically available for the lender to use in case a borrower fails to repay a loan during the specified duration in the loan. You can only claim collateral of a loan you funded.
* Withdraw loan: This button can be used by the borrower of a loan to withdraw the loan after it has been funded by a lender.
* Repay loan: This button is available to only the borrower of a loan such that before the end of the loan duration, the borrower uses it to repay the borrowed amount with interest.
* Withdraw collateral: In the event that there is no lender of a loan you created as a borrower, you can use this button to withdraw your collateral back. You can use this button only when your loan has not been funded.

### HederaFund Decentralized Chat System
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcKMCjPeLAYgQ7weTzGb3aTXLVmaVueRQVB2HwfSps9vM)
For effective communication between borrowers and lenders, HederaFund provides a built-in decentralized chat system. Only the borrower and lender associated with a specific loan can communicate through this chat.
Please note: do not send funds directly to the lender or borrower. All transactions are securely managed by the dApp itself.

### HederaFund Token (HDF)
The HederaFund Token (HDF) is the native token of the HederaFund platform and is primarily used as collateral for lending activities.
In addition to HDF, users can also use other supported tokens like USDT and DAI as collateral.

## HederaFund Swap Feature
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmNaHE7mvrezc2dSmj8CWoe8ta38CQu6c4YacS6hfuHKG9)
HederaFund offers a seamless and secure token swap feature, to ensure accurate and reliable token swaps. This allows users to efficiently swap a variety of tokens directly within the platform.

Currently, users can swap the following tokens:
